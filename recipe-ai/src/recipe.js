Sink your teeth into these thick, soft & chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. These cookies are loaded with spiced cinnamon, raisins and chewy oats.

# Ingredients

* 1 cup (229 g) unsalted butter, cold
* 1 1/2 cups (330 g) light brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 cup (95 g) granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) pure vanilla extract
* 2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cups (120 g) rolled oats
* 1 tablespoon (7 g) cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 cups (approximately 10 oz) Raisins

# Steps

* Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Soften the cold butter in the microwave for 10-15 seconds. Combine the softened butter with the brown and granulated sugar. Beat on medium speed until well combined, 2-3 minutes.
* Next add the eggs and vanilla extract and continue beating until well incorporated.
* In a separate bowl, combine the flour, oats, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Stir to combine and slowly add the dry ingredients into the dough, mixing on low speed until dough starts to form.
* Before the dough thickens, add the raisins. Beat a couple of times just until the flour incorporates.
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet. Scoop the dough using a large cookie scoop and place on a sheet pan, 2 inches apart.
* Bake for 11-13 minutes. The center of the cookie should be slightly under baked but not too gooey. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container.
